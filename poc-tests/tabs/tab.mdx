# Application Setup

Let's start by creating a new project, installing required dependencies, and setting up a basic server application.

## New Project
Create a new folder for your project, navigate to it in the command line, and initialize a new Node.js project:

<CodeGroup>
```sh Node
npm init -y
```

```powershell NET
dotnet new web
```
</CodeGroup>
Next, install all the dependencies we're going to use. In this case it will be dotenv (utility for initializing environment variables from a file), Express.js (web framework), an Express.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data requests, and finally the various packages of the official APS SDK:

The "dependencies" in your package.json file should now look something like this (potentially with slightly different version numbers):

<CodeGroup>
  ```sh Node
  npm install --save dotenv express express-formidable
  npm install --save @aps\_sdk/authentication @aps\_sdk/model-derivative @aps\_sdk/oss
  ```

  ```powershell NET
  dotnet add package Autodesk.Authentication
  dotnet add package Autodesk.ModelDerivative
  dotnet add package Autodesk.OSS
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup>
The "dependencies" in your package.json file should now look something like this (potentially with slightly different version numbers):
```javascript packages.json
...
"dependencies": \{
  "@aps\_sdk/authentication": "^1.0.0",
  "@aps\_sdk/model-derivative": "^1.0.0",
  "@aps\_sdk/oss": "^1.0.1",
  "dotenv": "^16.4.1",
  "express": "^4.18.2",
  "express-formidable": "^1.2.0"
},
...
```

The \*.csproj file in your project should now look similar to this (possibly with slightly different version numbers, and additional .NET settings):
```csharp web.csproj
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
 <PropertyGroup>
   <TargetFramework>net8.0\</TargetFramework>
 </PropertyGroup>
 <ItemGroup>
   <PackageReference Include="Autodesk.Authentication" Version="2.0.0" />
   <PackageReference Include="Autodesk.ModelDerivative" Version="2.0.0" />
   <PackageReference Include="Autodesk.OSS" Version="2.0.0" />
 </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

Finally, let's create a couple more subfolders in your project folder that we're going to need later:

Controllers - this is where we're going to implement all the server endpoints
Models - here we're going to keep all the server-side logic that can be shared by different endpoints
wwwroot - this is where we're going to put all the client side assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.)
Now, when you open your project folder in Visual Studio Code for the first time, you will be prompted to setup your project for .NET development. Accept the prompt, and the editor will automatically create a .vscode subfolder with additional .NET specific settings such as the default launch configuration. The folder structure in the editor should look similar to this:
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
If the .vscode folder is not created automatically, you can create it via the Run & Debug sidepanel.
</Note>

<Tip>
To create the .vscode folder click on the Run and Debug tool on the left sidepanel > create a launch.json file > Select .NET & .NET Core.
</Tip>
